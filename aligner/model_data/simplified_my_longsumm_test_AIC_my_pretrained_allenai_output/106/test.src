the paper presents a generalized framework for graph clustering ( clusters of network motifs ) on the basis of higher-order connectivity patterns .
approach given a motif m , the framework aims to find a cluster of the set of nodes s such that nodes of s participate in many instances of m and avoid cutting instances of m ( that is only a subset of nodes in instances of m appears in s ) .
mathematically , the aim is to minimise the motif conductance metric given as cutm ( s , s ’ ) / min [ volm ( s ) , volm ( s ’ ) ] where s ’ is complement of s , cutm ( s , s ’ ) = number of instances

mining high-speed data streams – domingos & hulten 2000 this paper won a ‘ test of time ’ award at kdd ’ 15 as an ‘ outstanding paper from a past kdd conference beyond the last decade that has had an important impact on the data mining community. ’ here ’ s what the test-of-time committee have to say about it : this paper proposes a decision tree learner for data streams , the hoeffding tree algorithm , which comes with the guarantee that the learned decision tree is asymptotically nearly identical to that of a non-incremental learner using infinitely many examples .
this work constitutes a significant step

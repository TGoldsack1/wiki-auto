we seeing an explosion of uncertain data behaviouri .
e. , data data data that is more properly by probability distributions estimated values with error rather than values in iot , sampling-based approximate computations and machine learning algorithms .
In many cases , performing computations computations on uncertain data as if they were exact lead to people who could not be incorrect .
It develops unfortunately , developing for uncertain data is a major challenge from both the mathematical and performance perspective .
In this paper , this paper proposes and for tackling this data processing systems .
we present a framework for uncertainty propagation ( up ) ( up ) that allows developers to use it .
dag dag to implementation of modest effort .
This is known with effort .

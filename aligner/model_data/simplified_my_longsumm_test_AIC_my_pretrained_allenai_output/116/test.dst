learningable and transferable and transferable tasks and performing single , complex tasks are difficult .
Some traditional hierarchical techniques use this decomposition in a top-down and meta-learning techniques a task distribution to learn such things such as decompositions .
This paper presents a framework for using different ways to decompose complex task solutions into simpler modular subpolicies .
This framework performs automatic decomposition of a single source task in a bottom up manner , concurrently learning the required modular learning as a controller to coordinate we perform a series of experiments on high-dimensional action tasks to show the effectiveness of this .

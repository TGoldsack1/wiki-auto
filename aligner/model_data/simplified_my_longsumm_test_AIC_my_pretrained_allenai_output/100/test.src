that ’ s the world of byzantine fault tolerance ( bft ) .
we ’ ve looked at practical bft ( pbft ) and honeybadger on previous editions of the morning paper .
today ’ s paper , beat , builds on top of honeybadger to offer bft with even better latency and throughput .
asynchronous bft protocols are arguably the most appropriate solutions for building high-assurance and intrusion-tolerant permissioned blockchains in wide-are ( wan ) environments , as these asynchronous protocols

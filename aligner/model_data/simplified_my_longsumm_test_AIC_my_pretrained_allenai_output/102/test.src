abductive reasoning is the inference to the most plausible explanation .
even though it is considered to be an important component for understanding narratives , the work in this domain is sparse .
a new dataset called as abstractive reasoning in narrative text ( art ) consisting of 20k narrative contexts and 200k explanations is also provided .
the dataset models the task as multiple-choice questions to make the evaluation process easy .
task setup given a pair of observations o1 and o2 and two hypothesis

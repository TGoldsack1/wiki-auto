networks are an important tool for understanding and modeling complex systems in physics , engineering , and social science .
Many networks have rich , lower-order connectivity patterns that can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges .
It is about .
However , organization of complex networks changed the level of network name remains largely unknown .
we develop a framework for we develop a good framework for a generalized framework .
The framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges .
The framework a number of people in a number of units in the neuronal networks and structure in transportation structure transportation structure .

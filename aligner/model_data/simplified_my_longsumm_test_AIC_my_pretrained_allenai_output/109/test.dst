The intelligent machine is one of the biggest challenges in computer in this paper , and some fundamental properties of these machines should have , focusing in particular on in and learning .
we talk about a simple environment that could be used to teach a machine the basics of natural-language-based communication , to more complex interaction with human users .
we also have some conjectures on the sort of algorithms the machine should support in order to learn from the environment .
A machine can perform complex tasks without needing without would be in almost endeavor , almost all of the task , from performing a certain way .

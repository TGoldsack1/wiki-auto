scalable atomic visibility with ramp transactions – bailis et al .
2014 ramp transactions came up last week as part of the secret sauce in coordination avoidance in database systems that contributed to a 25x improvement on the tpc-c benchmark .
so what exactly are ramp transactions and why might we need them ?
as soon as you partition your database across multiple servers , things start to get interesting .
we ’ d like to maintain atomic isolation – either all of a transaction ’ s effects are visible or none are – for transactions that span partitions… the status quo for these multi-partition atomic transactions
